### Abstract
Our ability to combine words and bound morphemes defines the communica- tive potential of human language. But when exerting this ability on continuous speech, we are constrained by the instruments of our brain. Specifically, our brain processes both speech and text in a windowed manner rather than continuously. Here, autocorrelation analysis in 21 languages shows that chunks of multiple words follow each other at similar durations, when defining chunks as clusters of local syntactic dependencies, consistent with psycholinguistic research. This periodic pace of chunks may have evolved for human language to be processed well by the periodic electrophysiological activity of our brain—ensuring that one chunk of words that are densely connected by syntactic dependencies can always be processed within one cycle of electrophysiological activity.

# Main script

You can run the code itself on a treebank:

```
python main.py  --ftreebank path-to-treebank
		--outpath path-to-save-output-file 
		--csv (optional, if present will save stats to csv) 
		--save_lengths (optional, if present will save chunk lengths)
		--no_punc (optional, if present will remove punctuation token which have no dependents)
		--sweep_unitaries (optional, if present will attempt to attach unitary chunks which neighbour non-unitary chunks if syntactically linked)
```

There's also some plotting scripts in `src/plotting/` that were used to generate the plots we shared here, in case that's of any interest.

# Scripts to get treebanks of interest and label all

```
python get_treebank_subset.py
```

creates a file `treebank-list.txt` of treebanks with more than 10000 tokens using `ud-tts-ud-corpus.csv`

We usually create a soft link to our ud data:

```
ln -s path/ud-treebanks-v2.9
```

Otherwise edit `collect_subset.sh` to change the path to the data directory

```
./collect_subset.sh treebank-list.txt
```

Copies the directories from `ud-treebanks-v2.9`. The treebanks are saved in `ud-subset-v2.9`


```
./label-all.sh \
```

Runs the chunk labeller on all the treebanks in `ud-subset-v2.9` and saves the labelled data in `ud-labelled-v2.9`. It's set to run so that the stats are saved in `chunk-stats.csv` and the lengths of each chunk in each treebank is saved in `lengths`.
